    "text": "A gerund is a verb form that ends in \"-ing\" and functions as a noun in a sentence. This means that even though it looks like an action word (verb), it is used as a thing (noun).\n\nFor example:\n- **Swimming** is fun.\n  - Here, \"swimming\" is usually a verb, but in this sentence, it is the subject of the sentence, so it's acting like a noun.\n  \n- I enjoy **reading**.\n  - In this sentence, \"reading\" is the thing that I enjoy, so itâ€™s a noun acting as the object of the sentence.\n\nGerunds can be used in different parts of a sentence, just like nouns can be.\n- As the subject: **Traveling** can be expensive.\n- As the object: She likes **dancing**.\n\nRemember, if it looks like a verb (because of the \"-ing\") but acts like a thing, it's a gerund!"
