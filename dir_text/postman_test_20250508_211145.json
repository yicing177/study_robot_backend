    "text": "A gerund is a verb form that ends in \"-ing\" and functions as a noun in a sentence. You can think of it as a verb that's being used like a thing or an action.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"Swimming is fun,\" the word \"swimming\" is a gerund. Even though \"swimming\" originally comes from the verb \"swim,\" here it's acting as the subject of the sentence, which is a noun's job.\n\nHere are a few more examples:\n\n1. \"I enjoy reading.\"\n   - \"Reading\" acts as the object of the verb \"enjoy.\"\n\n2. \"Her favorite hobby is painting.\"\n   - \"Painting\" is used as a complement to the subject \"hobby.\"\n\n3. \"They talked about going to the park.\"\n   - \"Going\" is the object of the preposition \"about.\"\n\nIn each case, the gerund helps by describing an action but plays the role of a noun."
