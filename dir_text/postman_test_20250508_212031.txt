A gerund is a verb form that ends in "-ing" and functions as a noun in a sentence. This means that even though it looks like an action word (verb), it is used as a thing (noun).

For example:
- **Swimming** is fun.
  - Here, "swimming" is usually a verb, but in this sentence, it is the subject of the sentence, so it's acting like a noun.
  
- I enjoy **reading**.
  - In this sentence, "reading" is the thing that I enjoy, so itâ€™s a noun acting as the object of the sentence.

Gerunds can be used in different parts of a sentence, just like nouns can be.
- As the subject: **Traveling** can be expensive.
- As the object: She likes **dancing**.

Remember, if it looks like a verb (because of the "-ing") but acts like a thing, it's a gerund!
